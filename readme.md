## Dom Ramon's Band

### This is a simple work that I developed for studying purposes. It is a sample of what the website for a band based on a sitcom I liked when I was a kid could be like. Chaves del ocho. It contains a home page, an about page with descriptions of some characters and a store which simulates the purchase of prodocts such as hats, shirts and CDs. It also contains, in two of those pages, a bottom navigation bar linked to some social media plataforms.

### Only HTML, CSS and Javascript were used to develop these pages. 

### 0.1 - This is what the home page looks like.

### 0.5 - Trying to add the same item twice will display a message: "This items is already added to the cart".

### 0.7 - This is what happens when the purchase button is clicked. A message is displayed: "Thank you for your purchase". Then all the items are removed from the cart.
